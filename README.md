Program 4
Connor Steele
==========================

General Notes
   - I switched from Neph heads to Bunnys at the last minute. My shading was acting strange on the heads
   - The light is coming from the position that the TV screen is centered at
   - Phong Shading was implemented for geometry
   - There are 10 Bunnies
   - There are 10 Hierarchically modeled orbiting spheres

Build and Run Instructions:
   - Use the included .sln file inside of Visual Studio and run the Local Windows Debugger. 
   Make sure that under the properties windows the Windows SDK version is up to date.
   
Used Code:
   - My Lab 8 and Lab 8 basecode
   - My Program 2b Cylinder Code

   
Hierarchically Modeled Animation:
   - I used one sphere obj and multiple primitives to create a sphere that has objects hierarchically
   modeled to orbit around it.
